# Keywords in Go  

Keywords or reserved words are used internally by the Go programming language for specific purposes or represent predefined actions. These words cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., variable or function names). Attempting to do so will result in a compile-time error.  

## Total Keywords  
Go has **25 reserved keywords**, which are essential for writing programs. Below is a list of these keywords, each linking to its description:  

1. [break](#break)  
2. [case](#case)  
3. [chan](#chan)  
4. [const](#const)  
5. [continue](#continue)  
6. [default](#default)  
7. [defer](#defer)  
8. [else](#else)  
9. [fallthrough](#fallthrough)  
10. [for](#for)  
11. [func](#func)  
12. [go](#go)  
13. [goto](#goto)  
14. [if](#if)  
15. [import](#import)  
16. [interface](#interface)  
17. [map](#map)  
18. [package](#package)  
19. [range](#range)  
20. [return](#return)  
21. [select](#select)  
22. [struct](#struct)  
23. [switch](#switch)  
24. [type](#type)  
25. [var](#var)

## Detailed Keyword Descriptions  

### `break`  
Used to terminate the nearest enclosing loop or `switch` statement.  

### `case`  
Defines specific conditions in a `switch` statement.  

### `chan`  
Declares a channel type for goroutines to communicate.  

### `const`  
Defines immutable variables with constant values.  

### `continue`  
Skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next one.  

### `default`  
Specifies the fallback case in a `switch` statement when no conditions match.  

### `defer`  
Delays the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.  

### `else`  
Executes a block of code if the `if` condition is false.  

### `fallthrough`  
Forces execution to continue to the next case in a `switch`, regardless of conditions.  

### `for`  
The primary loop construct in Go for iterating or running repetitive tasks.  

### `func`  
Defines a function or method in Go.  

### `go`  
Starts a new goroutine for concurrent execution.  

### `goto`  
Transfers control unconditionally to a labeled statement.  

### `if`  
Executes a block of code based on a true condition.  

### `import`  
Imports packages into the current Go file.  

### `interface`  
Defines a set of method signatures that a type must implement.  

### `map`  
Declares a map, a collection of key-value pairs.  

### `package`  
Specifies the package name for a Go file.  

### `range`  
Iterates over elements in an array, slice, map, or channel.  

### `return`  
Exits a function and optionally provides a return value.  

### `select`  
Used in concurrent programming to wait on multiple channel operations.  

### `struct`  
Defines a composite data type grouping related fields.  

### `switch`  
A control statement for selecting one among many possible blocks of code.  

### `type`  
Defines new data types, including aliases and structs.  

### `var`  
Declares a variable, optionally initializing it.
