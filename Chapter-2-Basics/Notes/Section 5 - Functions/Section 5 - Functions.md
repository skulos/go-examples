# Section 5 - Functions

Functions are a fundamental building block in programming. They allow you to organize code into reusable and logical pieces. This section will explore the basics of function declarations, return values, and advanced function techniques.

Introduction
Functions enable the modularization of programs, making code easier to read, debug, and maintain. They allow encapsulation of logic and support parameterization for dynamic execution.

In this section, we'll start with simple function declarations, examine how to work with return values, explore advanced types like closures and variadic functions, and conclude with special functions like init and main.

Section 5.1 - Simple Declaration
In this subsection, we'll explore how to declare a basic function, understand its syntax, and use it effectively in your programs.

Section 5.2 - Return Value
Functions often produce results by returning values. This subsection will guide you through handling return values, including:

Single Return Values
Multiple Return Values
Named Return Values

Section 5.3 - Functions as Values
Functions in many programming languages are first-class citizens, meaning they can be treated like any other value. This allows for powerful techniques like passing functions as arguments or returning them from other functions.

Section 5.4 - More Function Types
In this subsection, we explore advanced function types:

Closures – Functions that capture their surrounding context.
Variadic Functions – Functions that accept a variable number of arguments.
Section 5.5 - Init & Main Function
The init function is automatically called before the program's execution, setting up necessary configurations. The main function serves as the entry point of the program.

Section 5.6 - Defer
The defer keyword allows you to schedule function calls to run at the end of the surrounding function's execution, making cleanup and resource management simpler.
