## Introduction
Control flow is the foundation of any programming language, enabling the program to react to various inputs, conditions and loops.

Control flow can be broken up into two major sections:
1. Repetitive operations
2. Decision-making


### Section 4.1 If-Else Statements
---
Often, a program needs to make a decision - should some code execute or not? This is also called conditional execution. In programming, this is handled by `if-else statements`. In this section, we will learn how to make decisions based on conditions.

### Section 4.2 Switch Statements
---
In general, `if-else statements` are used for simple conditions, i.e., where there are only two options: `true` (yes) or `false` (no).

However, it is often necessary to consider more than two possibilities. What if the result of a condition could be one option out of 20 possible options? `Switch statements` provide a structured way to handle multiple possible outcomes for conditions.


### Section 4.3 Loops
---
In programming, we often need to perform a task more than once. Sometimes, we don't know exactly how many times we need to repeat a task when writing a program - all we know is that something needs to be repeated.

In this section, we will explore techniques for repeating code blocks, including `for`, `while` (conditional `for`), and infinite loops.
