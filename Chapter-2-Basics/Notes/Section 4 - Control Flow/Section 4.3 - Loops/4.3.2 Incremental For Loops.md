# Section 4.3.2 - Incremental For Loops

In this section we will be going through incremental loops, also known as the **traditional for loop**, which is commonly used to iterate a specific number of times.

Let's imaginge I ask you to print some output twice to the terminal. A simple enough task.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Something")
    fmt.Println("Something")
}
```

The output would be

```
Something
Something
```

Now, let's repeat this task but do it 10 times.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Something")
    fmt.Println("Something")
    fmt.Println("Something")
    fmt.Println("Something")
    fmt.Println("Something")
    fmt.Println("Something")
    fmt.Println("Something")
    fmt.Println("Something")
    fmt.Println("Something")
    fmt.Println("Something")
}
```

The output would be

```
Something
Something
Something
Something
Something
Something
Something
Something
Something
Something
```

Okay, now let's do this 100 times... Uhm no! That would be too much. But what is evident is that it's the same task over and over. That is writing `fmt.Println("Something")` for every iteration.

Now, since we know we can repeat tasks using `for loops` let's introduce a **second** for for the `for loops`, the incremental loop.

An incremental for loop in Go has three parts:

1. **Initialization**: A variable is initialized before the loop starts.
2. **Condition**: The loop runs as long as this condition evaluates to true.
3. **Post-statement**: A statement executed after each iteration, typically used to update the loop variable.

```go
for initialization; condition; post-statement {
    // Code to execute
}
```

Let's do a simple example. The task is to count to 5 and print out the numbers to the terminal. We start by *initializes* the variable `i` to `0`.

Let's do some more examples.

#### Example 1: Count to 5

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Initialization, Condition, Post-statement
    for i := 0; i < 5; i++ { 
        fmt.Println("Count:", i+1)
    }
}
```
Output:

```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

Here’s what happens in each step of the loop:

1. Initialization: `i` is set to `0`.
2. Condition: `i < 5`. If true, the loop runs; otherwise, it stops.
3. Execution: The code block inside the loop is executed.
4. Post-statement: `i++` increases `i` by 1.

Incremental loops can also be used to perform actions in a `table` like manner. Observe the pattern of `i x j = k`:

```
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3

2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6

3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
```

How could we create a program using loops to create this output? Well let's start by looking at the pattern. There is a `1` followed by, `1`, `2` and `3`. 

```
1 x 1
1 x 2
1 x 3
```

We can put this into a loop like

```go
for j := 1; j <= 3; j++ {
    fmt.Println("1 x", j) // 1 x j
}
```

Since this pattern repeats for `2` and `3` we can create another loop. Let's call this first loop, the `inner loop` since we have a constant output of `1 x j` for the loop. And then we can use a `outer loop` where we increment `i` for an output of the form `i x j`. Let's put this together

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ { // Outer loop
        for j := 1; j <= 3; j++ { // Inner loop
            fmt.Printf("%d x %d = %d\n", i, j, i*j)
        }
    }
}
```
Output:

```
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
1 x 3 = 3

2 x 1 = 2
2 x 2 = 4
2 x 3 = 6

3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
```

#### Example 2: Breaking Out of a Loop

Sometimes, you want to exit a loop early. Use the `break` statement.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {
        if i == 5 {
            fmt.Println("Breaking at", i)
            break
        }
        fmt.Println("Count:", i)
    }
}
```
Output:

```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Breaking at 5
```

What we have done here is used a `if-statement` to decide when we want to break out early from a loop that is
suppose to continue running for much longer. Think of the `break` statement as cancelling the call to the loop
after it has started. 

Similar to `break` is `continue`. `break` stops the `for-loop` entirely. What if we want to only skip this iteration
of the loop? The `continue` keyword allows us to skip to the next iteration of the loop. Observe:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
        if i == 3 {
            fmt.Println("Skipping", i)
            continue
        }
        fmt.Println("Count:", i)
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Count: 1
Count: 2
Skipping 3
Count: 4
Count: 5
```

Now similarly to the idea of counting up to `5`, we can also design a loop to run backwards - that is counts down.
To do this we `decrement` (opposite of increment) the loop variable.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 5; i > 0; i-- {
        fmt.Println("Countdown:", i)
    }
    fmt.Println("Blastoff!")
}
```

**Output:**

```
Countdown: 5
Countdown: 4
Countdown: 3
Countdown: 2
Countdown: 1
Blastoff!
```
