# Section 4.3.3 Forever Loops

In Go, an infinite or forever loop can be created using the `for {}` syntax. These loops run continuously until an explicit break statement or program termination condition is encountered. Forever loops are useful for scenarios where you want to repeatedly perform a task until a specific condition arises, such as waiting for user input, handling background tasks, or continuously monitoring a resource.

Let's explore the syntax and practical examples of forever loops in Go.

### Syntax of Forever loops

---

A forever loop in Go uses the simplest form of the `for` statement:

```go
for {
    // Code that runs indefinitely
}
```

Since no **condition** is provided, this loop will keep executing indefinitely unless explicitly stopped using `break` or a `return` statement.


### Example 1: Basic Forever Loop with `break`

Here's a basic forever loop that prints numbers and exits when a condition is met:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    count := 0
    for {
        fmt.Println("Count:", count)
        count++

        if count >= 5 {
            break // Exit the loop when count reaches 5
        }
    }
    fmt.Println("Loop ended.")
}
```

Output:

```
Count: 0
Count: 1
Count: 2
Count: 3
Count: 4
Loop ended.
```

In this example, the loop runs indefinitely until count reaches `5`, at which point the `break` statement terminates the loop.


### Example 2: Forever Loop with User Input

Forever loops are commonly used when waiting for user input. Here's a program that repeatedly prompts the user until they type "quit":


```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    var command string

    for {
        fmt.Print("Enter a command (type 'quit' to exit): ")
        fmt.Scan(&command)

        if command == "quit" {
            fmt.Println("Exiting program.")
            break
        }

        fmt.Println("You entered:", command)
    }
}
```

Output

```go
Enter a command (type 'quit' to exit): hello
You entered: hello
Enter a command (type 'quit' to exit): quit
Exiting program.
```

### Example 3: Forever Loop with `continue`

The `continue` statement can be used to skip the remaining code in the loop body and go to the next iteration:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    num := 0
    for {
        num++

        if num%2 == 0 {
            continue // Skip even numbers
        }

        fmt.Println("Odd number:", num)

        if num >= 7 {
            break // Stop the loop when num reaches 7
        }
    }
}
```

Output

```
Odd number: 1
Odd number: 3
Odd number: 5
Odd number: 7
```

Here, `continue` skips the printing step for even numbers, and the loop stops when num reaches 7.


### Key Points to Remember

1. Forever loops (`for {}`) run indefinitely unless you use `break`, `return`, or another exit condition.
   
2. Use cases include waiting for user input, handling background tasks, or continuously polling resources.

3. The `break` statement exits the loop immediately.
   
4. The `continue` statement skips to the next iteration of the loop.
