# 4.3.1 Conditional For Loops

This section starts with the second part of [Control Flow](../Section%204%20-%20Control%20Flow.md) - namely, repetition.

In programming, it's often necessary to do a task more than once. Now repeating a task is usually one of three types of repeatition:

1. conditional
2. incremental
3. forever

In this section we will be going through conditional loops. **Conditional Loops** are similar to `if statements` in that there is a condition that gets evaluated - however, the `if statement` can be seen as a single **evaluation-execution**. The `for loop` behaves in a similiar manner, but after the first **evaluation-execution**, a second **evalution** is performed to see if the condition is still `true`. If `true`, then **execute** the block again, if `false` move past the `for loop`.

Here’s the general syntax for a for loop in Go:

```go
for condition {
    // Code to execute
}
```

You can also think of this as

```go
for true {
    // Execute block
}
```

For more simply in terms of 

```go
if true {
    // Repeat block
}
```

> 💡*Note*
> ---
> The `condition` is evaluated at the start of each iteration. It is also very important to remember that per iteration there should be a chance for the condition to change. Otherwise there will be an **infinite loop**.

#### Example 1: Count Down

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    count := 5

    for count > 0 {
        fmt.Println(count)
        count--
    }

    fmt.Println("Liftoff!")
}
```

The output should be something like this

```
5
4
3
2
1
Liftoff!
```

#### Example 2: Summing Numbers

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    sum := 0
    i := 1

    for sum < 100 {
        sum += i
        fmt.Println("i:", i, "Sum:", sum)
        i++
    }

    fmt.Println("Sum reached:", sum, "after", i, "attemps")
}
```

With the output being

```go
i: 1 Sum: 1
i: 2 Sum: 3
i: 3 Sum: 6
...
i: 13 Sum: 91
i: 14 Sum: 105
Sum reached: 105 after 15 attempts
```

#### Example 3: Input Validation

A common use case for conditional loops is ensuring valid user input.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var num int

    for num <= 0 {
        fmt.Print("Enter a positive number: ")
        fmt.Scan(&num)

        if num <= 0 {
            fmt.Println("Invalid input. Please try again.")
        }
    }

    fmt.Println("You entered:", num)
}
```

##### Output
```
Enter a positive number: -5
Invalid input. Please try again.
Enter a positive number: 0
Invalid input. Please try again.
Enter a positive number: 10
You entered: 10
```

### Common Pitfalls
---

Forgetting to update the condition can lead to infinite loops:

```go
count := 5
for count > 0 {
    fmt.Println(count)
    // Missing `count--` leads to an infinite loop
}
```
