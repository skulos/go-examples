# Section 4.2 - Switch Statements

Switch statements are another way to control the flow of a program, similar to `if-else`, but they are often used when you have multiple possible values for a single variable. They can make the code more readable and concise when handling multiple conditions.

Imagine a situation where you want to assign a reward based on a user's membership tier. Each tier—Basic, Silver, Gold, or Platinum—earns a specific reward. Instead of writing multiple `if-else` statements, you can use a `switch` statement.

### What is a Switch Statement?
---

A switch statement allows you to test a variable or an expression against multiple possible values and execute a corresponding block of code.

Here’s the general syntax for a switch statement in Go:
```go
switch expression {
case value1:
    // Code to execute if expression == value1
case value2:
    // Code to execute if expression == value2
default:
    // Code to execute if no cases match
}
```

> 💡*Note*
> ---
> Unlike other languages, `break` statement is automatically added at the end of each case.

Let's look at the example in the introduction

#### Example: Assigining Rewards

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    membershipTier := "Gold"
    reward := ""

    switch membershipTier {
    case "Basic":
        reward = "5% discount voucher"
    case "Silver":
        reward = "10% discount voucher"
    case "Gold":
        reward = "20% discount voucher"
    case "Platinum":
        reward = "30% discount voucher"
    default:
        reward = "No reward"
    }

    fmt.Printf("Your reward: %s\n", reward)
}
```

For `membershipTier = "Gold"`, the output will be:

```
Your reward: 20% discount voucher
```

Let's look at another example, what day of the week is it?

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    day := "Monday"

    switch day {
    case "Monday":
        fmt.Println("Start of the workweek!")
    case "Friday":
        fmt.Println("Almost the weekend!")
    case "Saturday", "Sunday": // Multiple cases can share the same block
        fmt.Println("It's the weekend!")
    default:
        fmt.Println("It's a regular weekday.")
    }
}
```

For `day = "Monday"`, the program prints:

```
Start of the workweek!
```

For `day = "Saturday"`, the program prints:

```
It's the weekend!
```

### Key Features of Switch Statements
---

1. **No Fallthrough by Default**
    
    In Go, switch statements do not fall through to the next case by default. Each case ends automatically after executing the block unless you explicitly use the fallthrough keyword.

    Let's look at an example of no fallthrough and then one with fallthrough.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    number := 2

    switch number {
    case 1:
        fmt.Println("One")
    case 2:
        fmt.Println("Two")
    case 3:
        fmt.Println("Three")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Other")
    }

    // Output: Two
}
```
Now, with fallthrough - we continue to the next case. Observe:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    number := 2

    switch number {
    case 1:
        fmt.Println("One")
    case 2:
        fmt.Println("Two")
        fallthrough
    case 3:
        fmt.Println("Three")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Other")
    }
}
```


2. **Multiple Values in a Case**
    
    A single case can match multiple values by separating them with commas.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    char := 'a'

    switch char {
    case 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u':
        fmt.Println("Vowel")
    default:
        fmt.Println("Consonant")
    }
}
```

See how we use multiple values in a single case.

3. **Switch Without a Condition**

    You can omit the expression in a switch statement and directly use boolean conditions in the case blocks.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    age := 20

    switch {
    case age < 13:
        fmt.Println("Child")
    case age >= 13 && age < 20:
        fmt.Println("Teenager")
    case age >= 20:
        fmt.Println("Adult")
    }

    // Output: Adult
}
```


Switch also supports shorthand declaration like this.

```go
switch day := "monday"; day {
case "monday":
    fmt.Println("time to work!")
case "friday":
    fmt.Println("let's party")
default:
    fmt.Println("browse memes")
}
```

### Benefits of Switch Statements
---

- They make code more readable and concise, especially when dealing with multiple possible outcomes for a single variable.
- They can evaluate multiple cases with similar conditions in one statement.
- By default, they prevent unintended fallthrough, reducing bugs.
  
Switch statements are a powerful tool in Go for simplifying conditional logic and improving code clarity.
