# Section 4.1 - If-Else Statements

Control flow is a fundamental concept in programming, enabling a program to make decisions about certain code that should run or not.

A example would be a special. If you spend more than 500, you get free delivery. What we have here is a choice that the program needs to make when it comes to determining if someone needs to pay delivery.
Does the total spending add up to 500 or not? If it does, we need to do something - apply free delivery. If the total spending is less than 500, we add delivery fees.

Notice how we use `if`, in programming we use the same [keyword](../../../../Resources/KEYWORDS.md) to represent a simple `true` or `false` choice called a `condition`.


### What is an If Statement?
---

An `if statement` allows a program to make decisions. It checks a condition and executes one block of code if the condition is true and skips over the block if the condition is false.

Here’s a simple visual representation:

```
if (condition is true):  
    Execute this block 
```

In Golang, the syntax is similar but more concise. Below is the basic structure of an if statement in Golang:

```go
if condition {
    // Code to execute if the condition is true
}
```

You can also think of this as

```go
if true {
    // statements here will always run
}
```

##### Examples
Case 1: Total spending is greater than 500

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    totalSpending := 650 // var totalSpending int = 650
    deliveryFee := 0

    if totalSpending < 500 {
        deliveryFee = 250 // This block doesn't run
    }

    // deliveryFee = 0
}
```

Case 2: Total spending is less than 500

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    totalSpending := 439
    deliveryFee := 0

    if totalSpending < 500 {
        deliveryFee = 250 // This blocks run
    }

    // deliveryFee = 250
}
```

Notice how the code inside the if block only runs if the condition is true. Otherwise, it’s skipped.

### Boolean Conditions

Golang uses (which evaluate to `true` or `false`) to determine the outcome of conditional statements like `if`, `else`, `switch` and loops. These expressions often involve:  

- **Relational Operators**: Compare two values. (e.g., ==, !=, <, >)  
- **Logical Operators**: Combine or negate boolean expressions. (e.g., &&, ||, !) 


#### Relational Operators 
---

The following relational operators are available:  

| Operator | Description                          | Example              |
|----------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `==`     | Equal to                            | `5 == 5` → `true`    |
| `!=`     | Not equal to                        | `5 != 3` → `true`    |
| `<`      | Less than                           | `3 < 5` → `true`     |
| `>`      | Greater than                        | `7 > 2` → `true`     |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to               | `4 <= 4` → `true`    |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to            | `6 >= 5` → `true`    |

These operators return a `true` or `false` value based on the comparison.  



#### Example: Using Relational Operators  

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    a := 10
    b := 20

    fmt.Println(a == b)  // false
    fmt.Println(a != b)  // true
    fmt.Println(a < b)   // true
    fmt.Println(a > b)   // false
    fmt.Println(a <= b)  // true
    fmt.Println(a >= b)  // false
}
```

#### Logical Operators
---

| Operator | Description                                  | Example                          | Result  |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND (true if both conditions are true) | `(5 > 3) && (4 < 6)`             | `true`  |
| `\|\|`     | Logical OR (true if at least one condition is true) | `(5 > 10) \|\| (3 < 8)`            | `true`  |
| `!`      | Logical NOT (inverts the boolean value)     | `!(5 == 5)`                      | `false` |


#### Boolean Expressions
Let’s combine relational and logical operators in a real-world example:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    accountBalance := 100
    accountCredit := 200

    if accountBalance + accountCredit > 0 {
        fmt.Println("You have money to spend.")
    }
}
```
This program will output the following

```sh
You have money to spend.
```

Because the condition `accountBalance + accountCredit > 0` evaluates to `true` since 100 + 200 = 300 is greater than 0.

More complex boolean expressions can be contructed. However, so far we are only checking if a condition is true. How can we handle the case where we want a block of code to execute if a condition is true, or run another block if the condition is false. Introducing `else`, the else statement runs whenever the preceding if statement is false.

Let's take a look at the delivery example again.

##### Examples
Case 3: Total spending is greater than 500

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    totalSpending := 650
    deliveryFee := 0

    if totalSpending > 500 {
        deliveryFee = 0
    } else {
        deliveryFee = 250
    }

    // deliveryFee = 0
}
```

Case 4: Total spending is less than 500

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    totalSpending := 439
    deliveryFee := 0

    if totalSpending > 500 {
        deliveryFee = 0
    } else {
        deliveryFee = 250
    }

    // deliveryFee = 250
}
```

### Else-If Statements
---

The `else if` statement allows you to check multiple conditions in sequence. It is used when you have more than two possible outcomes and want to evaluate each condition separately.

The structure looks like this:

```go
if condition1 {
    // Code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if condition2 {
    // Code to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if neither condition1
    // nor condition2 is true
}
```

In this structure:

- The first if checks `condition1`.
- If `condition1` is false, the program moves to the next `else if` and checks `condition2`.
- If `condition2` is also false, the program moves to the `else` block, which is executed when all previous conditions fail.


#### Example: Using else if

Let’s consider a scenario where we check if someone is eligible for a discount based on their total spending:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    totalSpending := 150
    discount := 0

    if totalSpending > 500 {
        discount = 20 // 20% discount for spending over 500
        fmt.Println("You get a 20% discount!")
    } else if totalSpending > 200 {
        discount = 10 // 10% discount for spending over 200
        fmt.Println("You get a 10% discount!")
    } else {
        discount = 5 // 5% discount for spending under 200
        fmt.Println("You get a 5% discount!")
    }

    // Display the final discount amount
    fmt.Printf("Your discount is: %d%%\n", discount)
}
```

For `totalSpending = 150`:
```
You get a 5% discount!
Your discount is: 5%
```

For `totalSpending = 350:`
```
You get a 10% discount!
Your discount is: 10%
```


For `totalSpending = 600:`
```
You get a 20% discount!
Your discount is: 20%
```
